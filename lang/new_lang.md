# New Language
This language will have free word order (**but only within the same phrase**, which is a sentence that only has one case. A phrase can have multiple genitive cases, but only if they are exactly before a word that has another case, for example: the man's-GEN dog-NOM killed his-GEN neighbor's-GEN baby-ACC) due to the declensions affecting the adjectives, nouns, etc. It will have singular, dual, and plural grammatical Numbers. It will be Nominative–accusative, meaning "die-1Sg" means "I die" and "kill-1Sg 3Sg" means "I kill them". The general word order is SOV, but it can become SVO in informal texts and conversations. Free word order is often abused when it comes to poetry, which is a good thing.

This language will have Cases and Prepositions for those cases, which aren't necessarily required. For example "He goes to the store": "he to store-*ALL* go" is the same as "he store-*ALL* go". In formal texts, it's expected to use prepositions, but can be cut off for the sake of brevity.

The use of all formal conventions is known as Formal, and the practice of forgoing some or all of those conventions is known as Informal. As the names imply, Formal is used in formal settings, such as drafting a law, writing a book, or for use at a job. Informal, however, can be used between friends, when you need to write a message but you don't have enough time, used between family, used in conversations, etc.

The aim of this language with the short declensions of nouns and adjectives, as well as the short conjugations of verbs is to be as succint and easy to pronounce as possible. It should be able to encode a lot more information than English in a shorter amount of words, while also being easy to read and pronounce.
